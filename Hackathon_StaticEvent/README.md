# Modality 4: Static Event - Technical Presentation


## Challenge

Present your hackathon solutions to a panel of judges and fellow participants, demonstrating both your technical expertise and communication abilities. This is not just about what you built, but how well you can explain it.

### Format
- **Presentation Duration**: Exactly 10 minutes
- **Q&A Session**: 5-10 minutes following the presentation
- **Audience**: Technical jury and other participating teams

## Key Objectives

### 1. **Clear Communication** 
Communicate complex concepts using appropriate technical vocabulary while ensuring accessibility

### 2. **Work Showcasing** 
Justify your development choices with:
- Quantitative metrics and benchmarks
- Comparative analysis with alternative approaches
- Trade-off discussions

### 3. **Time Management** 
- Target: 10 minutes exactly

## Presentation Tips

### Technical Excellence
- **Use precise terminology** - But define complex terms when first introduced
- **Show, don't just tell** - Use diagrams, flowcharts, and visualizations
- **Include metrics** - Runtime, accuracy, memory usage, etc.
- **Compare approaches** - "We chose X over Y because..."

### Structure & Flow
- **Start strong** - Hook your audience with the problem's importance
- **Tell a story** - Guide the audience through your problem-solving journey
- **Use transitions** - Connect sections smoothly
- **End memorably** - Summarize key achievements

### Visual Aids
- **Keep slides clean** - Maximum 6 lines per slide
- **Use diagrams** - Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, state machines
- **Show results** - Graphs, comparisons, demos
- **Code sparingly** - Only show critical snippets, syntax-highlighted

### Delivery
- **Practice timing** - Rehearse multiple times
- **Speak clearly** - Technical doesn't mean monotone
- **Make eye contact** - Engage with your audience
- **Handle nerves** - Deep breaths, pause when needed

## Final Advice

Remember: The best technical solution poorly explained loses to a good solution well presented. Your goal is to make the jury understand and appreciate your work's value.
