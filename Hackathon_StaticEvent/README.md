## üí° Presentation Tips

### Technical Excellence
- **Use precise terminology** - But define complex terms when first introduced
- **Show, don't just tell** - Use diagrams, flowcharts, and visualizations
- **Include metrics** - Runtime, accuracy, memory usage, etc.
- **Compare approaches** - "We chose X over Y because..."

### Structure & Flow
- **Start strong** - Hook your audience with the problem's importance
- **Tell a story** - Guide the audience through your problem-solving journey
- **Use transitions** - Connect sections smoothly
- **End memorably** - Summarize key achievements

### Visual Aids
- **Keep slides clean** - Maximum 6 lines per slide
- **Use diagrams** - Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, state machines
- **Show results** - Graphs, comparisons, demos
- **Code sparingly** - Only show critical snippets, syntax-highlighted

### Delivery
- **Practice timing** - Rehearse multiple times
- **Speak clearly** - Technical doesn't mean monotone
- **Make eye contact** - Engage with your audience
- **Handle nerves** - Deep breaths, pause when needed

## ü§î Q&A Preparation

### Anticipate Questions About:
- **Design decisions**: Why this algorithm/architecture?
- **Performance**: Bottlenecks, optimization opportunities
- **Scalability**: How would this work with larger datasets?
- **Edge cases**: How does your solution handle failures?
- **Comparisons**: How does this compare to existing solutions?

### Best Practices:
- **Listen carefully** - Understand the question before answering
- **Be honest** - It's okay to say "That's a great point we didn't consider"
- **Stay technical** - Support answers with data when possible
- **Be concise** - Don't ramble; answer directly
