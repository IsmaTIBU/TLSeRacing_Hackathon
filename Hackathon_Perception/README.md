# Perception modality
## Tasks  
Fine-tunne an Image Classification pretrained AI model [MobileNetV2](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/MobileNetV2) with the [Cifar100](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar100?hl=en) dataset, which is composed by 60000 32x32 RGB images divided in 100 classes.

## Objectives
- Mean accuracy >99.5% over 1000 examples, the higher the accuracy compared to other teams the better the score
- Building a CNN as simple as possible, adding as few parameters as possible
